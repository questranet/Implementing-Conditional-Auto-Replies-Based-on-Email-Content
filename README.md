# Implementing-Conditional-Auto-Replies-Based-on-Email-Content
This is the third part of my project build, which by the way is a tool built around solving a real world challenge. In this project, I will be defining conditions for my auto-replies, updating my Power Automate flow, "Email Automate", then testing and validating the new build.
